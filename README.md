<b>The Overview</b></br>
I bought a book called "Proverbs for Daily Living" at a Goodwill, almost 20 years ago.
All the book contains is an individual saying (called a 'proverb' by the book, but we shall call them 'Pearls of wisdom,' or 'Pearls' going forward.</br></br>
I have read this book everyday for all of these years, never skipping ahead, never going back. It has broght me tons of joy and insight.</br></br>
I can find nothing about this book out on the interwebs, so I have decided to bring its greatness to future generations.</br></br>
<b>The Project</b></br>
I intend to build an app that displays:</br>
* The date (no year required as it all repeats every year)</br>
* The Pearl, from the book that is associated with that day.</br>
* A field where a user can enter their own own Pearl, complete with a submit button.</br>
* A Twitter login feature that will either:</br>
  a) Allow the user to enter a Pearl via Twitter, and pass that Pearl back to my database</br>
  b) Access the user-submitted Pearls (userPearls)on Twitter<br>
* A self-cooked login to be used for admin functions (edit and delete Pearls).</br></br>
